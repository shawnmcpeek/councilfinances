# Review the conversation to avoid repeating mistakes
# Review the codebase for correct inclusion/implementation
# Review outside sources for proper implementation
# Use the most simple and straightforward solution
# If making changes or correcting errors, don't ask me if I want you to continue, the answer is always yes
# Keep secrets secret. I have a .env file for you for a reason
# Always use proper project formatting
# Keep all styling in a global css and use it for all aspects
# Keep all styling simple. Use the same styling for all buttons, unless something like width difference is necessary. Then at least make them look the same with different width.
# For styling fixes, identify the correct pattern first and enforce it consistently. No incremental fixes - ensure full compliance with global styling rules.
# My computer has Java SDK 21 and 23. We will not use any SDK previous to 21.
# If I ask a question or start a dialogue/discussion, only respond. You can provide example code, but do not start changing code. I will tell you when I am ready to resume code.
# this is a very separated component app. There are re-usable components like log_display that gets used in different locations. Same with organizer_toggle and program_dropdown. Don't re-create them in individual components, import and implement them in the components as specified.
